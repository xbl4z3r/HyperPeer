# HyperPeer
A bad attempt at live chat application.
I tried to do this when I was learning more on Websockets and OAuth. I never finished it since I was trying to add some many features and make it so complicated before I even tested if I can send messages between two clients. Please respect the license and don't bother creating Pull Requests or Issues since this is neither finished nor do I plan on finishing it. Also the API routes don't work so you'll have to make your own API if you want to continue this project for some reason. If you have any questions I'll try to answer it on discord: xbl4z3r
